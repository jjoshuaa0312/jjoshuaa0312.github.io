As the years have gone by, "," a career I have always been interested in the well-known field, Computer Science."," Even as a youth I have always been interested in fixing technology and technology in general. "," Every time there is something wrong with the WiFi Router or computer in my house, I am always the first one "," to be called to fix the issue and it is always fun to me whenever I work with technology. I obtained my interest"," in Technology or more specifically Computer Science starting as young as 10 months old. My plans to finally get a job as "," a computer scientist is to get into as many technical programs in my school to get recognized by a good University and pursue any"," specific field I would like such as game designer, computer engineer, lead director of a department. Many Computer Scientist works "," well with pressure, maybe to push a patch update to a video game or to turn in concept art for the newest trend, and I happen to"," have one of these qualities, I can persevere until 4 in the morning to make sure any school assignment gets done no matter how "," stress inducing it is. So I have a very dependable strength leading me to know I will be a computer scientist. Some of the"," moments throughout grade school I am proud of was attending an engineering summer program which helped guide me in the "," direction for my love of technology, I am also proud that I am able to easily achieve an A in my computer science class"," now and I love everything we do in this class. All in all, I am very excited to go into college and study my passion which "," is computer science hopefully my ability to be dependent upon will allow me to make lots of money from home and take care"," of my children and live the best life I can have. </p></div>","","</html>","","  "],"id":1}],[{"start":{"row":8,"column":12},"end":{"row":8,"column":20},"action":"remove","lines":["Jjoshuaa"],"id":2},{"start":{"row":8,"column":12},"end":{"row":8,"column":13},"action":"insert","lines":["i"]}],[{"start":{"row":8,"column":13},"end":{"row":8,"column":14},"action":"insert","lines":["n"],"id":3}],[{"start":{"row":8,"column":14},"end":{"row":8,"column":15},"action":"insert","lines":["d"],"id":4}],[{"start":{"row":8,"column":15},"end":{"row":8,"column":16},"action":"insert","lines":["e"],"id":5}],[{"start":{"row":8,"column":16},"end":{"row":8,"column":17},"action":"insert","lines":["x"],"id":6}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":8,"column":17},"end":{"row":8,"column":17},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1524796718892,"hash":"1dcac6e316782c64423f65260412a0934672778c"}
